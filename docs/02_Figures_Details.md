## Overview

This is a mock up of what it should look like (feel free to embellish) - https://sketch.cloud/s/9k8M/all/search/figure-details

### Features & Requirements

**Build an application that can do:**

1. Have the ability to select a figure
   1. Show a drawer with the figure's details on the right hand side
   2. When you click away from the details make the drawer disappear, and set the selected figure to `null`
2. Add a 'Fab' button to get ready for the add to cart functionality.

### Hints

Here are a couple of pointers to make sure you will be successful.

* Don't over think it
* Use state to keep track of things like the selected figure

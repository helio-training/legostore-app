# Figure Searching

> Searching and Filtering various Figures

## Overview

For this part of the assignment you'll need to build a figure searching screen.

This is a mock up of what it should look like (feel free to embellish) - https://sketch.cloud/s/dz9l/all/search/desktop.

### Features & Requirements

Use the data in the [`/docs/datasets/figures.js`](https://github.com/helio-training/legostore-app/blob/master/docs/datasets/figures.js) file.  Create an application called `legostore-app` using the create-react-app, initialize git and publish your code to your github profile.

**Build an application that can do:**

1. Search and filter the figures by: name, and price (you can filter price by the whole number before the decimal)
   1. Filter out any inactive figures
   2. Sort the figures by name (make sure your sorting doesn't harm the original array)
2. Create a top navigation screen with a drawer that opens when it's clicked
3. Deploy your react site to netlify or similar service

### Hints

Here are a couple of pointers to make sure you will be successful.

* Make sure to use filter, map, and reduce (it'll make this assignment a lot easier)
* Make sure your data is readonly (immutable)
* The mentor will be looking at your code to ensure that map, filter, and reduce is used (where appropriate)
* This repository can be used as an example, though, I'll utilize different patterns and practices to demonstrate various topics--some will not be optimal, but more for demonstration purposes (make sure you understand what pieces do what when utilizing for example code)
